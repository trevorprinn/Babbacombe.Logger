Babbacombe.Logger
=================

A C# 4.5 library for managing error logging and reporting. (There is also a build for .net 3.5).

Contains components for:
- Logging trace messages to log files.
- Handling and logging untrapped exceptions on all threads.
- Displaying trace messages in the UI.
- Sending log information to a website, from where email notifications can be sent out, or directly by email over SMTP.
